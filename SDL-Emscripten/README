This is an example of a project that was written in SDL2 and ported to Emscripten
Use the wasd keys to move the square.

I have also added the c file. If you want to compile it using emscripten you should enter the following command line
emcc /where/file/is.c -s USE_SDL=2 -o /where/you/want/file/to/be.html
